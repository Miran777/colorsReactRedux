This application allows you to select the color palette for the design.
To run it on your computer, you need to download the archive, open it with a code editor and enter the "npm i" command.
With this command, you will install all required libraries.
Next, to run it itself, type "npm run start" or "npm start".
And so, you launched the application and now you can choose colors.
When you press the "Space" key, unlocked colors will change. If you want to copy a certain color, you can click on its hex code with the left mouse button. You will have the names of all the colors on your screen in the hash, so if you want to select all at once, you can copy the link!
